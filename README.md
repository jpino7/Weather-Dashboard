# Homework-6 Weather Dashboard

# Introduction
This project was to create a Weather Dashboard application to allow the user to search weather in multiple cities

## Requirements
 * This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML with style incorporated into it and powered by jQuery and OpenWeather API.

### Design
 * index.html - designed with style and ability to function with jQuery
 * script.js - coded with jQuery to allow the calls of API's to display in cards.

### Project Acceptance Criteria
User opens the weather application and searches for a city. User is then presented with the current and future conditions for that city and the city is then added to recent searches.
When viewing the current weather conditions user is presented with the city name, date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
When viewing the future weather conditions for that city user is presented with a 5 Day Forecast that displays the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
